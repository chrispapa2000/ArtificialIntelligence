Έτσι μπορείτε να προσθέσετε queries με τα όποια μπορεί να παράγονται καλύτερες συστάσεις  (το αρχείο movie_metadata.csv περιέχει πολλές πληροφορίες ακόμα για κάθε ταινία όπως έτος κυκλοφορίας, βαθμολογία στο imdb, facebοok_likes κ.α.). Το συγκεκριμένο μέρος εργασίας είναι προπαρασκευαστικό οπότε όσο καλύτερα και πλουσιότερα τα ερωτήματα που θα φτιάξετε σε αυτό το μέρος τόσο καλύτερη θα είναι η απόδοσή των συστημάτων συστάσεων των επόμενων ερωτημάτων.\n","\n","Περισσότερες πληροφορίες για το dataset μπορείτε να διαβάσετε σε αυτό το [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/georgefila/movies-metadata).\n","### Μέρος 2: Recommendation System\n","Στο σημείο αυτό καλείστε με βάση αυτά που κάνατε στο μέρος 1 να κατασκευάσετε queries τα όποια θα σας επιστρέφουν παρόμοιες (σε χαρακτηριστικά) ταινίες. Τα ερωτήματα αυτά θα είναι κλιμακούμενα, δηλαδή θα υπάρχουν ερωτήματα που επιστρέφουν αρκετά κοινές ταινίες αλλά και που επιστρέφουν λιγότερο και λιγότερο κοινές (σε μια κλίμακα π.χ. από 1 σε 5). Για παράδειγμα:\n","\n","```\n","find_simmilar_movies_5(\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\", M).\n","M = \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\"\n","M = \"The Chronicles Of Narnia\"\n","M = \"Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time\"\n","...\n","```\n","Για παράδειγμα, το παραπάνω ερώτημα θα επιστρέφει αρκετά κοινές σε περιεχόμενο ταινίες με την ταινια \"Pirates Of The Caribbean\". Θα υπάρχουν και αντίστοιχα ερωτήματα που θα βρίσκουν λιγότερο όμοιες ταινίες. Ο δείκτης ομοιότητας των ταινιών είναι αυθαίρετος και μπορείτε να τον ορίσετε εσείς όπως θέλετε, αρκεί να υπάρχει κάποια λογική σύνδεση με τα δεδομένα που περιέχονται στο αρχείο movies_metadata.csv. \n","\n","Συνεπώς η συνάρτηση που θα κάνει τις προτάσεις (recommendation) με είσοδο μια ταινία πρέπει να επιστρέφει-εκτυπώνει μια λίστα με τις προτεινόμενες ταινίες κατά φθίνουσα σειρά ομοιότητας. \n","\n","\n","### 3ο Μέρος: Recommendation System Με βάση τις προτιμήσεις - Αξιολογήσεις του χρήστη\n","\n","\n","Σε αυτό το σημείο θα εργαστείτε με τα αρχεία ratings τα όποια περιέχουν αξιολογήσεις (από 1 μέχρι 5) για τις παραπάνω ταινίες. Το προηγούμενο σύστημα συστάσεων προτείνει στον χρήστη ταινίες αποκλειστικά με βάση την ομοιότητά τους. Σε αυτό το σημείο θα γίνει μια αναβάθμιση του συστήματος έτσι ώστε να παράγονται καλύτερες  συστάσεις οι όποιες θα λαμβάνουν υπόψιν και τις προτιμήσεις του χρήστη, οι όποιες θα εξάγονται από τις αξιολογήσεις που έχει κάνει μέχρι στιγμής. \n","\n","Η εκπαίδευση του recommender θα γίνεται ως εξής:\n","\n","Για κάθε ταινία θα υπάρχει ένα score το όποιο αρχικά θε είναι ίσο με 0 και θα διαμορφώνεται από τις αξιολογήσεις κάθε user. Έτσι για έναν χρήστη με βάση τις αξιολογήσεις που υπάρχουν στο αρχείο train_ratings θα πρέπει:\n","\n","1.\tΓια κάθε ταινία που έχει βαθμολογήσει να βρίσκονται οι κοινές ταινίες ανά κλίμακα και στο μέχρι τώρα σκορ κάθε παρόμοιας ταινίας θα προστίθεται ένα βάρος το όποιο θα μπορούσε να είναι το ποσοστό ομοιότητας της ταινίας (δηλαδή ένα βάρος για κάθε κλίμακα, αν δύο ταινίες μοιάζουν ενισχύουμε το βάρος που προσθέτουμε από το να μοιάζουν λιγότερο) επί τον βαθμό που έχει βάλει ο χρήστης για την αρχική ταινία (διαφορετικό είναι ο χρήστης να έχει βάλει 5/5 ή 1/5 σε μια ταινία από 3/5). \n","\n","2. Στη συνέχεια, ανάλογα με το σκορ που έχει σχηματιστεί για κάθε ταινία, θα επιλέγεται αν αυτή θα μπορούσε να είναι προτεινόμενη για τον χρήστη ή όχι και θα μετράμε το πόσο καλά τα πήγε το σύστήμά μας με βάση ορισμένες μετρικές.\n","\n","Η λογική πίσω από την παραπάνω διαδικασία είναι ότι παρόμοιες ταινίες θα έχουν ανάλογο βαθμό. Για παράδειγμα αν ένας χρήστης έχει αξιολογήσει αρκετές  ταινίες οι όποιες είναι sci-fiction με 5/5 τότε μια ταίνια sci-fiction την όποια δεν έχει δεί λογικά θα του αρέσει και θα έπρεπε να την προτείνουμε.\n","\n","Μετά την εκπαίδευση του συστήματος σας καλείστε να δοκιμάσετε τον recommender που κατασκευάσατε στην πράξη. Για τον σκοπό αυτό θα φορτώσετε το αρχείο test_ratings.csv όπου περιέχονται οι αξιολογήσεις του ίδιου χρήστη για άλλες ταινίες. Το σύστημά σας πρέπει να προβλέπει αν μια ταινία θα πρέπει να προταθεί στον χρήστη. Μια ταίνια θεωρούμε οτι προτείνεται στον  χρήστη, αν έχει βαθμό μεγαλύτερο του 3 στο test_ratings. Συνεπώς για την επίβλεψη του συστήματός σας θα πρέπει για κάθε μια από τις ταινίες του αρχείου test_ratings.csv να προβλέψετε εάν θα αρέσει στο χρήστη ή όχι ώστε να την προτείνετε. \n","\n","ΠΡΟΣΟΧΗ! Η \"βαθμολογία\" που θα υπολογίσετε για κάθε ταινία κατά το training δεν είναι απαραίτητα πρόβλεψη της βαθμολογίας που θα έβαζε ο χρήστης. \n","\n","Στην συνέχεια, σε συνδιασμό με τις πραγματικές απαντήσεις του χρήστη θα αξιολογήσετε το σύστημά σας χρησιμοποιόντας τις μετρικές: precision, recall, f1 οι οποίες είναι οι πλέον γνωστές μετρικές και ευρέως χρησιμοποιούμενες τεχνικές για την επίβλεψη-μέτρηση απόδοσης ανάλογων συστημάτων.\n","\n","1. Precision: Δείχνει πόσο ακριβές είναι το σύστημα. Υπολογίζει πόσα από τα στιγμιότυπα τα όποια προβλέψαμε ότι ανήκουν σε μια κλάση όντως ανήκουν σε αυτή. Η μετρική αυτή μας δίνει μια εικόνα σχετικά με τον αριθμό των ταινίων που προβλέψαμε ως προτεινόμενες ενώ δεν θα έπρεπε.\n","\n","2. Recall: Υπολογίζει πόσα από τα στιγμιότυπα που ανήκουν σε μια κλάση (π.χ. προτεινόμενες ταινίες) προβλέφθηκαν σωστά.\n","\n","3. F1: Είναι ένας μέσος μεταξύ των παραπάνω δυο μετρικών, έτσι ώστε να διατηρείται μια ισορροπία μεταξύ τους. Υπολογίζεται από την παρακάτω σχέση:\n","\n","$$F_1=2\\frac{Precision\\times{Recall}}{Precision+Recall}$$\n","\n","Οι παραπάνω συναρτήσεις παρέχονται από την βιβλιοθήκη scikit-learn.\n","\n","Τέλος για την καλύτερη επίβλεψη του συστήματος σας μπορείτε να εκπαιδεύσετε  τον recommender σας με ένα υποσύνολο ταινίων από ελάχιστες, λίγες μέχρι και πολλές (π.χ. 3, 5, 10, 50, ...) για να μελετήσετε κατά πόσο σας βοηθούν οι επιπλέον αξιολογήσεις κάθε φορά (δηλαδή κατά πόσο βελτιώνονται οι παραπάνω μετρικές στο test set). \n","\n","Έτσι π.χ. μπορείτε να εντοπίσετε περιπτώσεις όπως για παράδειγμα ότι με έναν recommender μπορεί να μην επιτυγχάνετε πολύ υψηλό σκορ όσο με άλλους, αλλά το βέλτιστο σκόρ σας επιτυγχάνεται πολύ γρηγόρα π.χ. με μόνο 10 ταινίες αντί 100. Έτσι για παράδειγμα αν ο αλγόριθμος τα πηγαίνει πολύ καλά για τρεις ταινίες και στη συνέχεια το σκορ βελτιώνεται ελάχιστα τότε αυτός ενδείκνυται για ένα σύστημα συστάσεων για νέους χρήστες όπου δεδομένου λίγων ταινιών ο αλγόριθμος είναι σε θέση να το να προτείνει καλές συστάσεις. Ενώ αν η καλύτερη απόδοση του αλγορίθμου σας είναι βέλτιστη με περισσότερες ταινίες π.χ. 50 τότε αυτός ο αλγόριθμος συστάσεων ενδείκνυται για παλιούς χρήστες με πολλές αξιολόγησεις.
